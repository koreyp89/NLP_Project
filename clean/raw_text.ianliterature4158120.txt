There are certain books that are always on lists of books you must read and the like, and these books are generally two things: old and complex.
After all, this weeks hot new bestseller is often an easy read for the simple reason that its part of the current zeitgeist  you dont have to work very hard to get the references and understand the relationships more or less intuitively.
Even the most ambitious books on the store shelves right now are easy enough to "get" because there are familiar aspects to the style and ideas, the sort of subtle stuff that marks something as fresh and current.
The books on must read lists tend to not only be deep, complex works of literature, they also trend towards older works that have survived the test of time for the obvious reason that theyre better than 99% of the books published.
But some of those books are also not simply complex and difficult, theyre also very, very long.
Lets be frank: When you start describing books as complex, difficult, and long, youre probably referring to Russian Literature.
We live in a world where "War and Peace" is often used as generic shorthand for an extremely long novel, after all  you dont need to have actually read the book to get the reference.
And yet, you should read the book.
Russian literature has long been one of the richest and most interesting branches of the literary tree, and has been supplying the world with incredible, fantastic novels for two centuries now  and continues to do so.
Because while this list of must read Russian literature includes plenty of the classics from the 19th century, there are also examples from the 20th and 21st century  and theyre all books that you really, really should read.

More than a century later, its still a powerful reading experience.
Grushins novel doesnt get the same attention as, say, "1984," but its just as horrifying in the way it outlines what its like to live in a dystopian dictatorship.
Sukhanov, once a rising artist, gives up his ambitions in order to toe the Communist Party line and survive.

From its evergreen opening line about happy and unhappy families, Tolstoys novel about the romantic and political entanglements of three couples remains remarkably fresh and modern.
Partly, this is due to the universal themes of social change and how people react to changing expectations  something that will always be meaningful to people of any era.

Gogols story concerns an official in the late-Tsarist era tasked with traveling from estate to estate investigating dead serfs (the souls of the title) who are still listed on the paperwork.
Concerned with what Gogol saw as the terminal decline of Russian life at the time (just a few decades before the revolution that destroyed the status quo), theres a lot of ink-black humor and a revelatory look at what life was like in Russia before the modern age.
Consider this: Bulgakov knew he could be arrested and executed for writing this book, and yet he wrote it anyway.
He burned the original in terror and despair, then re-created it.
When it was finally published, it was so censored and edited it barely resembled the actual work.

Really a poem, but a remarkably complex and lengthy poem, "Eugene Onegin" offers a bleak view of how society produces monsters by rewarding cruelty and selfishness.
While the complicated rhyme scheme (and the fact that its a poem at all) might be initially off-putting, Pushkin masterfully pulls it off.

Whats fascinating about this story of a pedophile and the insane lengths he goes to in order to possess a young girl he nick-names Lolita is how it offers insight into how Russians saw the rest of the world, especially America, while also being a brilliant novel whose uncomfortable subject matter resonates and disturbs precisely because its easy to imagine it actually happening.
A play and not a novel, and yet reading Chekhov's "Uncle Vanya" is almost as good as watching it performed.
The story of an elderly man and his young, alluring second wife visiting the country farm that supports them (with the secret intention of selling it and turning the titular brother-in-law who runs the estate out) is, at first blush, ordinary and even soap opera-ish.

Sometimes considered an outlier, Pasternaks novel is two things at once: a mesmerizing love story set against a truly epic historical background and a perceptive and well-observed look at the Russian Revolution from a remove.
The clear-eyed, objective way Pasternak depicts the various forces that were unleashed in Russia in 1917 was so disturbing to the authorities of the time that novel had to be smuggled out of the U. S. S. R.  in order to be published, and remains today both a beautifully-crafted story and a fascinating look at a world being changed right before peoples eyes.
